Clone an existing app to create a duplicate app on the same Kubernetes cluster or on another cluster. Cloning can help if you need to move applications and storage from one Kubernetes cluster to another. For example, you might want to move workloads through a CI/CD pipeline and across Kubernetes namespaces. You can use the Astra UI or https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/astra-automation/index.html[the Astra API] to clone and migrate apps.

NOTE: If you clone an app between clusters, the source and destination clusters must be the same distribution of Kubernetes. For example, if you clone an app from an OpenShift 4.7 cluster, use a destination cluster that is also OpenShift 4.7.

When Astra Control Center clones an app, it creates a clone of your application configuration and persistent storage.

NOTE: S3 buckets in Astra Control Center do not report available capacity. Before backing up or cloning apps managed by Astra Control Center, check bucket information in the ONTAP or StorageGRID management system.

.Steps

. Click *Apps*.
. Click the drop-down list in the *Actions* column for the desired app.
. Click *Clone*.

. *Clone details*: Specify details for the clone:
+
* Enter a name.
* Enter a namespace for the clone.
* Choose a destination cluster for the clone.
* Choose whether you want to create the clone from an existing snapshot or backup. If you don't select this option, Astra Control Center creates the clone from the app's current state.

. *Source*: If you chose to clone from an existing snapshot or backup, choose the snapshot or backup that you'd like to use.

.Result

Astra Control Center clones that app based on the information that you provided.

NOTE: After a data protection operation (clone, backup, restore) and subsequent persistent volume resize, there is up to a twenty-minute delay before the new volume size is shown in the UI. The data protection operation is successful within minutes, and you can use the management software for the storage backend to confirm the change in volume size.
