You can configure several optional settings to enhance your Astra Control Center experience. To add an additional layer of security, add a proxy server. To monitor and gain insight into your complete infrastructure, create a connection to NetApp Cloud Insights. To collect data and logs from your containers, add a Fluent Bit connection.

== Add a proxy server

To add an additional layer of security, you can add a proxy server. A proxy server is needed if you want to use Cloud Insights and AutoSupport with your Astra Control Center.

.Steps

. Log in to Astra Control Center using an account with *admin* privilege.
. Select *Account* > *Connections*.
. Select the drop-down list in the *HTTP Proxy* section to add the connection to a proxy server.
. Enter the proxy server name or IP address and the proxy port number.
. If you want to use authentication, select the checkbox, and enter the username and password.
. Select *Connect*.

.Result

If the connection was successful, the *HTTP Proxy* section of the *Account* > *Connections* page indicates that it is connected, and displays the server name.

You can edit the proxy server settings.

.Steps

. Log in to Astra Control Center using an account with *admin* privilege.
. Select *Account* > *Connections*.
. Select the drop-down list in the *HTTP Proxy* section to edit the connection.
. Edit the server details and authentication information.

=== Disable proxy server connection

You can disable the proxy server connection. You will be warned before you disable it about potential disruption to other connections, such as Cloud Insights, that require a proxy server.

.Steps

. Log in to Astra Control Center using an account with *admin* privilege.
. Select *Account* > *Connections*.
. Select the drop-down list in the *HTTP Proxy* section to disable the connection.
. In the dialog box that opens, confirm the operation.

== Connect to Cloud Insights

To monitor and gain insight into your complete infrastructure, connect NetApp Cloud Insights with your Astra Control Center instance. Cloud Insights is included in your Astra Control Center license.

NOTE: If you have an air-gapped installation, you cannot connect to Cloud Insights.

.What you'll need

* An Astra Control Center account with *admin* privileges.
* A valid Astra Control Center license.
* The Astra Control Center subscription and the Cloud Insights subscription should be registered under the same *admin* user.
* A proxy server.

TIP: If you are new to Cloud Insights, familiarize yourself with the features and capabilities link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloudinsights/index.html[here^].

.Steps

. Log in to Astra Control Center using an account with *admin* privilege.
. Select *Account* > *Connections*.
. Select the drop-down list in the *Cloud Insights* section to add the connection.
. Enter the Cloud Insights API token and the tenant URL.If you do not have the tenant URL, see the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloudinsights/task_cloud_insights_onboarding_1.html[Cloud Insights documentation^].
.. To get the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloudinsights/API_Overview.html#api-access-tokens[API token^], log in to your Cloud Insights tenant URL.
.. In Cloud Insights, generate a user-specific API key.
.. Copy the API key from Cloud Insights into Astra Control Center.
. Select *Connect*.

NOTE: To enable linking between Astra Control Center and Cloud Insights without requiring repeated logins, Astra Control Center needs an SSO configuration that matches Cloud Insights.

.Result

If the connection was successful, the *Cloud Insights* section of the *Account* > *Connections* page indicates that it is connected, and displays the tenant URL. You can visit Cloud Insights to see data being successfully received and displayed. You can also go to the Astra Control Dashboard and see the available data.
