Managing storage clusters in Astra Control as a storage backend enables you to get linkages between persistent volumes (PVs) and the storage backend as well as additional storage metrics. You can monitor storage capacity and health details, including performance if Astra Control Center is connected to Cloud Insights.

For instructions on how to manage storage backends using the Astra Control API, see the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/astra-automation/[Astra Automation and API information^].


You can complete the following tasks related to managing a storage backend:

* <<Unmanage a storage backend>>
* <<Update a storage backend license>>
* <<Add nodes to a storage backend cluster>>

//
//== Add a storage backend

//You can add an already discovered storage backend from either the Dashboard or from the Backends option.

//.Steps from the Dashboard
//. From the Dashboard do one of the following:
//.. From the Dashboard Storage backend section, select *Manage*.
//.. From the Dashboard Resource Summary > Storage backends section, select *Add*.
//. Enter the ONTAP admin credentials and select *Review*.
//. Confirm the backend details and select *Manage*.
//+
//The backend appears in the list with summary information.

//.Steps from the Backends option

//. In the left navigation area, select *Backends*.
//. Select *Manage*.
//. Enter the ONTAP admin credentials and select *Review*.
//. Confirm the backend details and select *Manage*.
//+
//The backend appears in the list with summary information.
//. To see details of the storage backend, select it.
//+
//TIP: Persistent volumes used by apps in the managed compute cluster are also displayed.


== View storage backend details
You can view storage backend information from the Dashboard or from the Backends option.

=== View storage backend details from the Dashboard

.Steps
. From the left navigation, select *Dashboard*.
. Review the Storage backend section that shows the state:
+
* *Unhealthy*: The storage is not in an optimal state. This could be due to a latency issue or an app is degraded due to a container issue, for example.
* *All healthy*: The storage has been managed and is in an optimal state.
* *Discovered*: The storage has been discovered, but not managed by Astra Control.

=== View storage backend details from the Backends option

View information about the backend health, capacity, and performance (IOPS throughput and/or latency).

With a connection to Cloud Insights, you can see the volumes that the Kubernetes apps are using, which are stored on a selected storage backend.

.Steps
. In the left navigation area, select *Backends*.
. Select the storage backend.
+
TIP: If you connected to NetApp Cloud Insights, excerpts of data from Cloud Insights appear on the Backends page.

. To go directly to Cloud Insights, select the *Cloud Insights* icon next to the metrics image.


== Unmanage a storage backend

You can unmanage the backend.

.Steps
.	From the left navigation, select *Backends*.
. Select the storage backend.
. From the Actions menu, select *Unmanage*.
. Type "unmanage" to confirm the removal.
. Select *Yes, remove storage backend*.

== Update a storage backend license
You can update the license for an Astra Data Store storage backend to support a larger deployment or enhanced features.

.What you'll need

* A deployed and managed Astra Data Store storage backend
* An Astra Data Store license file (contact your NetApp sales representative to purchase an Astra Data Store license)

.Steps

.	From the left navigation, select *Backends*.
. Select the name of a storage backend.
. Under *Basic Information*, you can see the type of license installed, if any.
+
If you hover over the license information, a popup appears with more information, such as expiration and entitlement information.
. Under *License*, select the edit icon next to the license name.
. In the *Update license* page, select *Add license*.
. Select a license file that you have obtained from NetApp.
. Select *Add*.
. Select *Update*.

== Add nodes to a storage backend cluster
You can add nodes to an Astra Data Store cluster, up to the number of nodes supported by the type of license installed for Astra Data Store.

.What you'll need

* A deployed and licensed Astra Data Store storage backend
* You have added the Astra Data Store software package in Astra Control Center
* One or more new nodes to add to the cluster

.Steps

.	From the left navigation, select *Backends*.
. Select the name of a storage backend.
. Under Basic Information, you can see the number of nodes in this storage backend cluster.
. Under *Nodes*, select the edit icon next to the number of nodes.
. In the *Add nodes* page, enter information about the new node or nodes:
.. Assign a node label for each node.
.. Do one of the following:
+
* If you want Astra Data Store to always use the maximum available number of nodes according to your license, enable the *Always use up to maximum number of nodes allowed* check box.
* If you don't want Astra Data Store to always use the maximum available number of nodes, select the desired number of total nodes to use.
.. If you deployed Astra Data Store with Protection Domains enabled, assign the new node or nodes to Protection Domains.
. Select *Next*.
. Enter IP address and network information for each new node. Enter a single IP address for a single new node, or an IP address pool for multiple new nodes.
+
If Astra Data Store can use the IP addresses configured during deployment, you don't need to enter any IP address information.
. Select *Next*.
. Review the configuration for the new node or nodes.
. Select *Add nodes*.
