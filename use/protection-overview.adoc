[role="quick-margin-para"]
Create a manual https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/astra-control-center/use/protect-apps.html#create-a-backup[backup^] of all apps, so that your apps are immediately protected.

==== image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-2.png[Two] Configure a protection policy for each app

[role="quick-margin-para"]
https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/astra-control-center/use/protect-apps.html#configure-a-protection-policy[Configure a protection policy^] for each app to automate future backups and snapshots. As an example, you can start with weekly backups and daily snapshots, with one month retention for both. Automating backups and snapshots with a protection policy is strongly recommended over manual backups and snapshots.

==== image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-3.png[Three] Optional: Adjust the protection policies as needed

[role="quick-margin-para"]
As apps and their usage patterns change, adjust the protection policies as needed to provide the best protection.

==== image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-4.png[Four] In case of a disaster, restore your apps

[role="quick-margin-para"]
