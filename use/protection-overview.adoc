You can create backups, clones, snapshots, and protection policies for your apps using Astra Control Center. Backing up your apps helps your services and associated data be as available as possible; during a disaster scenario, restoring from backup can ensure full recovery of an app and its associated data with minimal disruption. Backups, clones, and snapshots can help protect against modern threats like ransomware, accidental data loss, and environmental disasters. Learn about the available types of data protection in Astra Control Center, and when to use them, link:../concepts/data-protection.html[here].

== App protection workflow

You can use the following example workflow to get started protecting your apps.

==== image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-1.png[One] Back up all apps

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Create a manual backup of all apps, so that your apps are immediately protected. link:protect-apps.html#create-a-backup[Learn more].

==== image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-2.png[Two] Configure a protection policy for each app

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Configure a protection policy for each app to automate future backups and snapshots. As an example, you can start with weekly backups and daily snapshots, with one month retention for both. Automating backups and snapshots with a protection policy is strongly recommended over manual backups and snapshots. link:protect-apps.html#configure-a-protection-policy[Learn more].

==== image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-3.png[Three] Optional: Adjust the protection policies

[role="quick-margin-para"]
As apps and their usage patterns change, adjust the protection policies as needed to provide the best protection.

==== image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-4.png[Four] In case of a disaster, restore your apps

[role="quick-margin-para"]
If data loss occurs, restore the latest backup first for each app, followed by the latest snapshot (if available). link:restore-apps.html[Learn more].
