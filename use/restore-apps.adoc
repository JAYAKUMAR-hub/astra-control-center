Astra Control Center can restore your application configuration and persistent storage from a snapshot or backup. Persistent storage backups are transferred from your object store, so restoring from an existing backup will complete the fastest. You can use the Astra UI or https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/astra-automation/index.html[the Astra API] to restore apps.

NOTE: If you use Helm to deploy apps, Astra Control Center requires Helm version 3. Managing and cloning apps deployed with Helm 3 (or upgraded from Helm 2 to Helm 3) are fully supported. Apps deployed with Helm 2 are not supported.

.Steps

. Click *Apps* and then click the name of an app.
. Click *Data protection*.
. If you want to restore from a snapshot, keep the *Snapshots* icon selected. Otherwise, click the *Backups* icon to restore from a backup.

. Click *Restore application*.

. *Restore details*: Specify details for the clone:

* Enter a name and namespace for the app.

// Q2 note only; remove for Q3 and later - DOC-3548
NOTE: If you are restoring an app that has been deleted, choose a different name and namespace for the app than the original name. If the name for the restored app is the same as the deleted app, the restore operation will fail.

* Choose the destination cluster for the app.
* Click *Review*.

. *Restore Summary*: Review details about the restore action and click *Restore*.

.Result

Astra Control Center restores the app based on the information that you provided.

NOTE: After a data protection operation (clone, backup, restore) and subsequent persistent volume resize, there is up to a twenty-minute delay before the new volume size is shown in the UI. The data protection operation is successful within minutes, and you can use the management software for the storage backend to confirm the change in volume size.
