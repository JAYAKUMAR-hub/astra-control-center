= Upgrade Astra Control Center
:hardbreaks:
:icons: font
:imagesdir: ../media/get-started/

To upgrade Astra Control Center, do the following steps:

* <<Upgrade Astra Control Center>>
* <<Log in to the Astra Control Center UI>>

== Upgrade Astra Control Center

To upgrade Astra Control Center, download the installation bundle from the NetApp Support Site and perform a series a commands to upgrade the Astra Control Center Operator and Astra Control Center in your environment. You can use this procedure to upgrade Astra Control Center in internet-connected or air-gapped environments.

.What you'll need
* link:requirements.html[Before you begin upgrade, ensure your environment still meets the minimum requirements for Astra Control Center deployment].
* From your OpenShift cluster, ensure all cluster operators are in a healthy state (`available` is `true`):
+
----
oc get clusteroperators
----

* From your OpenShift cluster, ensure all API services are in a healthy state (`available` is `true`):
+
----
oc get apiservices
----
* Log out of your Astra Control Center.

.About this task
The Astra Control Center upgrade process guides you through the following high-level steps:

* <<Download the Astra Control Center bundle>>
* <<Unpack the bundle and change directory>>
* <<Copy the binary and push images to your local registry>>
* <<Install the updated monitoring operator>>
* <<Upgrade Astra Control Center>>
* <<Verify system status>>


NOTE: Podman commands can be used in place of Docker commands if you are using Red Hatâ€™s Podman repository.

== Download the Astra Control Center bundle

. Download the Astra Control Center upgrade bundle (`astra-control-center-[version].tar.gz`) from the https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/products/all/details/astra-control-center/downloads-tab[NetApp Support Site^].
. (Optional) Use the following command to verify the signature of the bundle:
+
----
openssl dgst -sha256 -verify astra-control-center[version].pub -signature <astra-control-center[version].sig astra-control-center[version].tar.gz
----

== Unpack the bundle and change directory

. Extract the images:
+
----
tar -vxzf astra-control-center-[version].tar.gz
----

. Change to the Astra directory.
+
----
cd astra-control-center-[version]
----

== Add the images to your local registry

. Add the files in the Astra Control Center image directory to your local registry.
+
NOTE: See a sample script for the automatic loading of images below.

.. Log in to your Docker registry:
+
----
docker login [your_registry_path]
----

.. Load the images into Docker.
.. Tag the images.
[[substep_image_local_registry_push]].. Push the images to your local registry.

+
----
export REGISTRY=[your_registry_path]
for astraImageFile in $(ls images/*.tar)
  # Load to local cache. And store the name of the loaded image trimming the 'Loaded images: '
  do astraImage=$(docker load --input ${astraImageFile} | sed 's/Loaded image(s): //')
  astraImage=$(echo ${astraImage} | sed 's!localhost/!!')
  # Tag with local image repo.
  docker tag ${astraImage} ${REGISTRY}/${astraImage}
  # Push to the local repo.
  docker push ${REGISTRY}/${astraImage}
done
----

== Install the updated monitoring operator

. Delete the existing `netapp-acc-operator` namespace. This ensures that the previously installed monitoring operator does not run.
+
----
~ kubectl delete namespace netapp-acc-operator
----

. Edit the Astra Control Center operator deployment yaml (`astra_control_center_operator_deploy.yaml`) to refer to your local registry and secret.
+
----
vim astra_control_center_operator_deploy.yaml
----
.. If you use a registry that requires authentication, replace the default line of `imagePullSecrets: []` with the following:
+
----
imagePullSecrets:
- name: astra-registry-cred
----

.. Change `[your_registry_path]` for the `kube-rbac-proxy` image to the registry path where you pushed the images in a <<substep_image_local_registry_push,previous step>>v.
.. Change `[your_registry_path]` for the `acc-operator-controller-manager` image to the registry path where you pushed the images in a <<substep_image_local_registry_push,previous step>>.

== Upgrade Astra Control Center

. Edit the Astra Control Center custom resource (CR) file (`astra_control_center_min.yaml`) and change the Astra version (`astraVersion`) number to the latest:
+
----
kubectl edit acc -n [netapp-acc or custom namespace] astra
----

. Verify that the pods terminate and become available again:
+
----
watch kubectl get po -n [netapp-acc or custom namespace]
----

== Verify system status

. Log in to Astra Control Center.
. Verify that all your managed clusters and apps are still present and protected.

== Upgrade third-party services
Third-party services, such as Traefik and Cert-manager, are not upgraded during earlier upgrade steps and must be upgraded separately. The following is the recommended sequence.

. Setup a `acc-helm-repo` `to use to upgrade Traefik and Cert-manager:
.. Find the `enterprise-helm-repo` that is loaded to your local Docker cache:
+
----
docker images enterprise-helm-repo
----
+
Response:

----
+
Response:
+
----
"acc-helm-repo" has been added to your repositories

???
. Update Traefik service using `acc-helm-repo`:
..











. Verify that all system components upgraded successfully.
+
----
kubectl get pods -n [netapp-acc or custom]
----
+
Each pod should have a status of `Running`. It may take several minutes before the system pods are deployed.

== Log in to the Astra Control Center UI

After installing ACC, you will change the password for the default administrator and log in to the ACC UI dashboard.

.Steps
. In a browser, enter the FQDN you used in the `astraAddress` in the  `astra_control_center_min.yaml` CR when <<Install Astra Control Center,you installed ACC>>.
. Accept the self-signed certificates when prompted.
+
NOTE: You can create a custom certificate after login.

. At the Astra Control Center login page, enter the value you used for `email` in `astra_control_center_min.yaml` CR when <<Install Astra Control Center,you installed ACC>>, followed by the one-time password (`ACC-[UUID]`).
+
NOTE: If you enter an incorrect password three times, the admin account will be locked for 15 minutes.

. Select *Login*.
. Change the password when prompted.
+
NOTE: If this is your first login and you forget the password and no other administrative user accounts have yet been created, contact NetApp Support for password recovery assistance.

. (Optional) Remove the existing self-signed TLS certificate and replace it with a link:../get-started/add-custom-tls-certificate.html[custom TLS certificate signed by a Certificate Authority (CA)].

== Troubleshoot the installation

If any of the services are in `Error` status, you can inspect the logs. Look for API response codes in the 400 to 500 range. Those indicate the place where a failure happened.

.Steps

. To inspect the Astra Control Center operator logs, enter the following:
+
----
kubectl logs --follow -n netapp-acc-operator $(kubectl get pods -n netapp-acc-operator -o name)  -c manager
----

== What's next

Complete the deployment by performing link:setup_overview.html[setup tasks].
