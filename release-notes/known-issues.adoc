Known issues identify problems that might prevent you from using this release of the product successfully.

== Incorrect ClusterRoleBinding created by Astra Control Center CRD during installation
//ASTRACTL-11352/DOC-3726
The following patch should be applied to all Kubernetes clusters where the acc-operator version 21.08.65 has been deployed. It should also be applied if the acc-operator is re-deployed. You can resolve this issue by running the following command:

[source,cli]
----
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f â€“
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: acc-operator-manager-rolebinding
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: acc-operator-manager-role
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: default
  namespace: netapp-acc-operator
EOF
----

The patch removes the following two subjects from `ClusterRoleBinding: "acc-operator-manager-rolebinding"`

----
- apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: Group
  name: system:serviceaccounts
- apiGroup: ""
  kind: Group
  name: system:serviceaccounts
----

== App with user-defined label goes into "removed" state
// ASTRACTL-9643
If you define an app with a non-existent k8s label, Astra Control Center will create, manage, and then immediately remove the app. To avoid this, add the k8s label to pods and resources after the app is managed by Astra Control Center.

== Unable to stop running app backup
// DOC-3552/ASTRACTL-9586
There is no way to stop a running backup. If you need to delete the backup, wait until it has completed and then use the instructions in link:../use/protect-apps.html#delete-backups[Delete backups]. To delete a failed backup, use the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/astra-automation/index.html[Astra API^].

== Backup or clone fails for apps using PVCs with decimal units in Astra Control Center
//ASTRACTL-9948/DOC-3612
Volumes created with decimal units fail using the Astra Control Center backup or clone process. See the link:https://kb.netapp.com/Advice_and_Troubleshooting/Cloud_Services/Astra/Backup_or_clone_may_fail_for_applications_using_PVCs_with_decimal_units_in_Astra_Control_Center[knowledgebase article] for more information.

== Astra Control Center UI slow to show changes to app resources such as persistent volume changes
// DOC-3563/ASTRACTL-9560/ASTRACTL-9540/AD AH
After a data protection operation (clone, backup, restore) and subsequent persistent volume resize, there is up to a twenty-minute delay before the new volume size is shown in the UI. This delay in the UI can also occur when any app resources are added or modified. In this case, a data protection operation is successful within minutes and you can use the management software for the storage backend to confirm the change in volume size.

== During app restore from backup Trident creates a larger PV than the original PV
// DOC-3562/ASTRACTL-9560
If you resize a persistent volume after creating a backup and then restore from that backup, the persistent volume size matches the new size of the PV instead of using the size of the backup.

== Clone performance impacted by large persistent volumes
//from ACS repo
Clones of very large and consumed persistent volumes might be intermittently slow, dependent on cluster access to the object store. If the clone is hung and no data has been copied for more than 30 minutes, Astra Control terminates the clone action.

== App clones fail using a specific version of PostgreSQL
//DOC-3543/ASTRACTL-9408
App clones within the same cluster consistently fail with the Bitnami PostgreSQL 11.5.0 chart. To clone successfully, use an earlier or later version of the chart.

== S3 buckets in Astra Control Center do not report available capacity
// DOC-3561/ASTRACTL-9425
Before backing up or cloning apps managed by Astra Control Center, check bucket information in the ONTAP or StorageGRID management system.

== Reusing buckets between instances of Astra Control Center causes failures
// ASTRACTL-9296 (Low probability)/ASTRACTL-9837/DOC-3575
If you try to reuse a bucket used by another or previous installation of Astra Control Center, backup and restore will fail. You must use a different bucket or completely clean out the previously used bucket. You can't share buckets between instances of Astra Control Center.

== Selecting a bucket provider type with credentials for another type causes data protection failures
//DOC-3560/ASTRACTL-9574
When you add a bucket, select the correct bucket provider type with credentials that are correct for that provider. For example, the UI accepts NetApp ONTAP S3 as the type with StorageGRID credentials; however, this will cause all future app backups and restores using this bucket to fail.

== Backups and snapshots might not be retained during removal of an Astra Control Center instance
//AD AH review
If you have an evaluation license, be sure you store your account ID to avoid data loss in the event of Astra Control Center failure if you are not sending ASUPs.

== Clone operation can't use other buckets besides the default
//DOC-3595/ASTRACTL-10071
During an app backup or app restore, you can optionally specify a bucket ID. An app clone operation, however, always uses the default bucket that has been defined. There is no option to change buckets for a clone. If you want control over which bucket is used, you can either link:../use/manage-buckets.html#edit-a-bucket[change the bucket default] or do a link:../use/protect-apps.html#create-a-backup[backup] followed by a link:../use/restore-apps.html[restore] separately.

== Managing a cluster with Astra Control Center fails when default kubeconfig file contains more than one context
//ASTRACTL-8872/DOC-3612
You cannot use a kubeconfig with more than one cluster and context in it. See the link:https://kb.netapp.com/Advice_and_Troubleshooting/Cloud_Services/Astra/Managing_cluster_with_Astra_Control_Center_may_fail_when_using_default_kubeconfig_file_contains_more_than_one_context[knowledgebase article] for more information.

== Can't determine ASUP tar bundle status in scaled environment
//DOC-3602/ASTRACTL-10186//AD AH
During ASUP collection, the status of the bundle in the UI is reported as either `collecting` or `done`. Collection can take up to an hour for large environments. During ASUP download the network file transfer speed for the bundle might be insufficient, and the download might time out after 15 minutes without any indication in the UI. Download issues depend on the size of the ASUP, the scaled cluster size, and if collection time goes beyond the seven day limit.

== Uninstall of Astra Control Center fails to clean up the monitoring-operator pod on the managed cluster
//DOC-3530/ASTRACTL-9496
If you did not unmanage your clusters before you uninstalled Astra Control Center, you can manually delete the pods in the netapp-monitoring namespace and the namespace with the following commands:

.Steps

----
oc delete agents acc-monitoring -n netapp-monitoring

+
----
oc delete ns netapp-monitoring
----
Result:
+
----
namespace "netapp-monitoring" deleted
----
. Confirm resources removed:
+
----
oc get pods -n netapp-monitoring
----
Result:
+
----
No resources found in netapp-monitoring namespace.
----
. Confirm monitoring agent removed:
+
----
oc get crd|grep agent
----
+
Sample result:
+
----
agents.monitoring.netapp.com                     2021-07-21T06:08:13Z
----
