You might want to try Astra Enterprise out for a short time. You can with the 90-day trial license.
Here's how.


==== image:number1.png[Number 1] Review Kubernetes cluster requirements

[role="quick-margin-list"]
* Astra supports Kubernetes clusters with Trident support of an ONTAP storage backend.
* Clusters must be running a healthy state, with at least one online worker node.
* The cluster must be running Kubernetes version 1.17 or later.
* The image type for each worker node must be **Ubuntu**.

==== image:number2.png[Number 2] Download and install Astra Enterprise
[role="quick-margin-list"]
* Download Astra Enterprise from the NetApp Support Site.
* Install Astra Enterprise in your local environment and let Astra Enterprise do this:
** Discover your Kubernetes clusters.
** Discover your Trident configuration backed by the ONTAP storage backend.

For our first release, you'll install the images on an OpenShift registry. We'll add more options later.
