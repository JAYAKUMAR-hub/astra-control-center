After you install Astra Control Center, log in to the UI, and change your password, you'll want to set up a license, add clusters, manage storage, and add buckets.

== Add a license for Astra Control Center
You can add a new license using the UI or https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/astra-automation/index.html[API] to gain full Astra Control Center functionality. Without a license, your usage of Astra Control Center is limited to managing users and adding new clusters.

.Before you begin
When you downloaded Astra Control Center from the  https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/products/all/details/astra-control-center/downloads-tab[NetApp Support Site], you also downloaded the NetApp license file (NLF). Ensure you have access to this license file.

NOTE: To update an existing evaluation or full license, see link:../use/update-licenses.html[Update an existing license].

////
.Options
* <<Add an evaluation license>>
+
NOTE: To update an existing evaluation or full license, see link:../use/update-licenses.html[Update an existing license].

=== Add a full or evaluation license

Astra Control Center licenses measure CPU resources using Kubernetes CPU units. Before adding a license, you need to obtain the license file (NLF) that you downloaded with the Astra Control Center installation bundle from the https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/products/all/details/astra-control-center/downloads-tab[NetApp Support Site].
//The CPU cores that Astra Control Center is deployed on are not counted against the CPU units consumed in the license.

You can also try Astra Control Center with an evaluation license, which lets you use Astra Control Center for 90 days from the date you activate the license. You need to work with your NetApp sales contact to obtain an evaluation license, which is associated with your NetApp Support account.

NOTE:  If your installation grows to exceed the licensed number of CPU units, Astra Control Center prevents you from managing new applications. An alert is displayed when capacity is exceeded.

.Steps
. Log in to the Astra Control Center UI.
. Select *Account* > *License*.
. Select *Add License*.
. Browse to the license file (NLF) that you downloaded.
. Select *Add License*.

The *Account* > *License* page displays the license information, expiration date, license serial number, account ID, and CPU units used.

== Add cluster

To begin managing your apps, add a Kubernetes cluster and manage it as a compute resource. You have to add a cluster for Astra Control Center to discover your Kubernetes applications.

.What you'll need

* A cluster running OpenShift 4.6 or later, which has Trident StorageClasses backed by ONTAP 9.5 or later.
** One or more worker nodes with at least 1GB RAM available for running telemetry services.
+
NOTE: If you plan to add a second OpenShift 4.6 or 4.7 cluster as a managed compute resource, you should ensure that the Trident Volume Snapshot feature is enabled. See the official Trident https://netapp-trident.readthedocs.io/en/stable-v21.04/kubernetes/operations/tasks/volumes/snapshots.html?highlight=volumesnapshot#on-demand-volume-snapshots[instructions] to enable and test Volume Snapshots with Trident.
* The superuser and user ID set on the backing ONTAP system to back up and restore apps with Astra Control Center (ACC). Run the following commands in the ONTAP command line:
`export policy rule modify -vserver svm0 -policyname default -ruleindex 1 -superuser sys`
`export-policy rule modify -policyname default -ruleindex 1 -anon 65534` (this is the default value)

* Clusters running the Docker daemon with logging that supports `json-file`. Enable this as follows:
. SSH into each worker node and edit the Docker configuration by using sudo:
+
`[docker@worker-0 ~]$ sudo vi /etc/sysconfig/docker`
. Change the `log-driver` from `journald` to `json-file` so that the options line reads as follows:
+
`OPTIONS='--selinux-enabled --log-driver=json-file --signature-verification=false'`
. Restart the Docker daemon:
+
`[docker@worker-0 ~]$ sudo systemctl restart docker`

.Steps
. From the *Dashboard* in the Astra Control Center UI, select *Add* in the Clusters section.
. In the *Add Cluster* window that opens, upload a `kubeconfig.yaml` file or paste the contents of a `kubeconfig.yaml` file.
+
NOTE: The `kubeconfig.yaml` file should include *only the cluster credential for one cluster*.
+
image:cluster-creds.png[Shows the screen to upload kubeconfig.yaml for cluster.]
+
IMPORTANT: If you create your own `kubeconfig` file, you should define only *one* context element in it. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/[Kubernetes documentation^] for information about creating `kubeconfig` files.

. Provide a credential name. By default, the credential name is auto-populated as the name of the cluster.
. Select *Configure storage*.
. Select the storage class to be used for this Kubernetes cluster, and select *Review*.
+
NOTE: You should select a Trident storage class backed by ONTAP storage.
+

. Review the information, and if everything looks good, select *Add cluster*.

.Result

The cluster enters the *Discovering* status and then changes to *Running*. You have successfully added a Kubernetes cluster and are now managing it in Astra Control Center.

== Add a storage backend

Add a storage backend to Astra Control so that Astra Control can manage your on-premises Kubernetes applications. Astra Control discovers and uses the already-deployed resources, including Trident, ONTAP, and associated storage classes. Managing storage clusters in Astra Control as a storage backend enables you to get linkages between persistent volumes (PVs) and the storage backend.

You can add an already discovered storage backend using these options:

* <<Add storage backend using Dashboard>>
* <<Add storage backend using Backends option>>

=== Add storage backend using Dashboard

. From the Dashboard do one of the following:
.. From the Dashboard Storage backend section, select *Manage*.
.. From the Dashboard Resource Summary > Storage backends section, select *Add*.
. Enter the ONTAP admin credentials and select *Review*.
. Confirm the backend details and select *Manage*.
+
The backend appears in the list with summary information.

=== Add storage backend using Backends option

. In the left navigation area, select *Backends*.
. Select *Manage*.
. Enter the ONTAP admin credentials and select *Review*.
. Confirm the backend details and select *Manage*.
+
The backend appears in the list with summary information.
. To see details of the backend storage, select it.
+
TIP: Persistent volumes used by apps in the managed compute cluster are also displayed.

== Add a bucket

Adding object store bucket providers is essential if you want to back up your applications and persistent storage or if you want to clone applications across clusters. Astra Control stores those backups or clones in the object store buckets that you define.

When you add a bucket, Astra Control marks one bucket as the default bucket indicator. The first bucket that you create becomes the default bucket.

You don’t need a bucket if you are cloning your application configuration and persistent storage to the same cluster.

Use any of the following bucket types:

* NetApp ONTAP S3
* NetApp StorageGRID S3
* Generic S3

TIP: Ensure you use a single bucket type; otherwise, mixing bucket types can cause errors.

NOTE: Although Astra Control Center supports Amazon S3 as a Generic S3 bucket provider, Astra Control Center might not support all object store vendors that claim Amazon’s S3 support.

For instructions on how to add buckets using the Astra API, see link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/astra-automation/[Astra Automation and API information].

.Steps

. In the left navigation area, select *Buckets*.
.. Select *Add*.
.. Select the bucket type.
.. Enter the existing bucket name and optional description.
+
TIP: The bucket name and description appear as a backup location that you can choose later when you’re creating a backup. The name also appears during protection policy configuration.

.. Enter the name or IP address of the S3 server.
.. If you want this bucket to be the default bucket for all backups, check the `Make this bucket the default bucket for this private cloud` option.
+
NOTE: This option does not appear for the first bucket you create.

.. Continue by adding <<Add S3 access credentials,credential information>>.

=== Add S3 access credentials

Add S3 access credentials at any time.

.Steps

. From the Buckets dialog, select either the *Add* or *Use existing* tab.
.. Enter a name for the credential that distinguishes it from other credentials in Astra Control.
.. Enter the access ID and secret key by pasting the contents from your clipboard.

== What's next?

Now that you’ve logged in and added clusters to Astra Control Center, you're ready to start using Astra Control Center's application data management features.
