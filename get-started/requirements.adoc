Get started by verifying support for your Kubernetes clusters, apps, licenses, and web browser.

== Kubernetes cluster general requirements

Astra Control Center requires one of the following types of host clusters:

* Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.6.8 to 4.8
* NetApp Rancher 2.5
* Kubernetes 1.21

The cluster must meet the following general requirements so you can discover and manage it from Astra Control Center.

* At least 300GB of available ONTAP storage capacity
* 3 controller nodes with 4 CPU cores, 16GB RAM, and 120GB of available storage each
* 3 worker nodes with at least 12 CPU cores, 32GB RAM, and 50GB of available storage each
//* Kubernetes version 1.19 or 1.20
* Service type "LoadBalancer" available for ingress traffic to be sent to services in the OpenShift cluster
* A method for pointing the FQDN of Astra Control Center to the load balanced IP address

NOTE: These requirements assume that Astra Control Center is the only application running on the OpenShift cluster. If the cluster is running additional applications, adjust these minimum requirements accordingly.

* *Image registry*: You must have an existing private Docker image registry to which you can push Astra Control Center build images. You must have the URL of the image registry where you will upload the images, and you must have tagged the images for the private container registry.

* *Astra Trident / ONTAP storage configuration*: Astra Control Center requires that Astra Trident version 21.07 or newer already be installed and configured to work with NetApp ONTAP version 9.5 or newer as the storage backend. Astra Control Center requires that a storage class be created and set as the default storage class. Astra Control Center supports the following ONTAP drivers provided by Astra Trident:

** ontap-nas
** ontap-nas-flexgroup
** ontap-san
** ontap-san-economy

If you are planning to manage the Kubernetes cluster from Astra Control Center as well as use the cluster to host the Astra Control Center installation, the cluster has the following additional requirements:

* The most recent version of the Kubernetes https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/snapshot-controller.html[snapshot-controller component^] is installed
* A Astra Trident https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-concepts/snapshots.html[volumesnapshotclass object^] has been defined by an administrator
* A default Kubernetes storage class exists on the cluster
* At least one storage class is configured to use Astra Trident
* A method for pointing the FQDN of Astra Control Center to the external IP address of the Astra Control Center service

Make sure that your cluster meets the minimum requirements and that you follow Kubernetes best practices so that Astra Control Center is highly available in your Kubernetes cluster.

[NOTE]
======================
During app cloning, Astra Control Center needs to allow OpenShift to mount volumes and change the ownership of files. Because of this, ONTAP needs to be configured to allow volume operations to complete successfully using the following commands:

. `export-policy rule modify -vserver svm0 -policyname default -ruleindex 1 -superuser sys`
. `export-policy rule modify -policyname default -ruleindex 1 -anon 65534`
======================

NOTE: If you plan to add a second OpenShift cluster as a managed compute resource, you need to ensure that the Astra Trident Volume Snapshot feature is enabled. See the official Astra Trident https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-use/vol-snapshots.html[instructions^] to enable and test Volume Snapshots with Astra Trident.

////
=== Non-OpenShift Kubernetes clusters
The Kubernetes cluster you use for Astra Control Center should already be deployed in your environment and you should have permissions to manage the cluster. This cluster should be preconfigured with the following:

* A load balancer with a static IP address or IP address range
* An internal domain name that is routed from an internal DNS server and points to the static IP address or IP address range of the cluster (the DNS name should point to the load-balanced IP address or addresses using the internal DNS server)
* A default storage provider in the Kubernetes cluster that is backed by a Trident storage class to work with ONTAP
* A single Trident StorageClass configured as the default
* Kubernetes version 1.18, 1.19, or 1.20
* At least 3 worker nodes
////

=== App management requirements
Astra Control Center has the following app management requirements:

* *Licensing*: You need an Astra Control Center license to manage apps using Astra Control Center.
* *Helm 3*: If you use Helm to deploy apps, Astra Control Center requires Helm version 3. Managing and cloning apps deployed with Helm 3 (or upgraded from Helm 2 to Helm 3) are fully supported. Managing apps deployed with Helm 2 is not supported.
//* *Operator management*: Astra Control Center does not support apps that are deployed with Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM)-enabled operators or cluster-scoped operators.
* *Operator-deployed apps*: Astra Control Center supports the following apps deployed with namespace-scoped operators:
** https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator/tree/v1.7.1[Apache Cassandra^]
** https://github.com/jenkinsci/kubernetes-operator[Jenkins CI^]
** https://github.com/percona/percona-xtradb-cluster-operator[Percona XtraDB Cluster^]
+
NOTE: If you clone an operator-deployed instance of Jenkins CI, you need to manually restore the persistent data. This is a limitation of the app's deployment model.

NOTE: Only one operator-deployed app is supported per namespace. An operator and the app it deploys must use the same namespace; you might need to modify the deployment .yaml file for the operator to ensure this is the case.

== Access to the internet

You should determine whether you have outside access to the internet. If you do not, some functionality might be limited, such as receiving monitoring and metrics data from NetApp Cloud Insights, or sending support bundles to the NetApp Support Site.
////
If you do have access to the internet, decide which of the following NetApp systems you will authorize Astra Control Center to integrate with:

* Cloud Insights for monitoring and metrics
* NetApp Support Site for Active IQ and SmartSolve processing
//* IPA for license automation
////

== License

Astra Control Center requires an Astra Control Center license for full functionality. Obtain an evaluation license or full license from NetApp. Without a license, you will be unable to:

// * Add clusters (de-scoped for Q2 release)
* Define custom apps
* Create snapshots or clones of existing apps
* Configure data protection policies

If you want to try Astra Control Center, you can link:setup_overview.html#add-a-full-or-evaluation-license[use a 90-day evaluation license].

== Service type "LoadBalancer" for on-premises Kubernetes clusters

Astra Control Center uses a service of the type "LoadBalancer" (svc/traefik in the Astra Control Center namespace), and requires that it be assigned an accessible external IP address. For on-premises OpenShift clusters, you can use https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/netapp-solutions/containers/rh-os-n_LB_MetalLB.html#installing-the-metallb-load-balancer[MetalLB^] to automatically assign an external IP address to the service. In the internal DNS server configuration, you should point the chosen DNS name for Astra Control Center to the load-balanced IP address.

NOTE: MetalLB version 0.11.0 is not supported.

////
Astra Control Center uses a service of the type "LoadBalancer" and requires the Kubernetes cluster to expose that service on an external IP address. For on-premises OpenShift clusters, NetApp has internally validated https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/netapp-solutions/containers/rh-os-n_LB_MetalLB.html#installing-the-metallb-load-balancer[MetalLB^] for use with Astra Control Center. In the internal DNS server configuration, you should point the chosen DNS name for Astra Control Center to the external IP address assigned to the service for Astra Control Center.
////

== Networking requirements

The cluster that hosts Astra Control Center communicates using the following TCP ports. You should ensure that these ports are allowed through any firewalls, and configure firewalls to allow any HTTPS egress traffic originating from the Astra network. Some ports require connectivity both ways between the cluster hosting Astra Control Center and each managed cluster (noted where applicable).

Before you deploy Astra Control Center, you should determine which internal integrations should occur, including the following:

* Single sign on
* SMTP server for email notifications

If you want to integrate these options, you should obtain the following:

* SSO integration confirmation details
* SMTP server configuration details
